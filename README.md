# Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms from Ground-Up

## Overview

Welcome to the **Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms from Ground-Up** project! This repository is dedicated to exploring classical machine learning algorithms and neural networks using vanilla Python and minimal use of libraries like NumPy and Pandas. The goal is to not only implement these algorithms but also to understand the underlying mathematical and statistical concepts that drive them.

## Objectives

This project has a twofold objective:

1. **Learning and Sharing**: 
   - To deepen my understanding of machine learning algorithms by implementing them from scratch.
   - To share my code and progress with the community, providing insights and explanations along the way.

2. **Bridging Paradigms**:
   - To bridge the gap between the procedural coding paradigm often used in data science and the object-oriented programming paradigm commonly found in software engineering.
   - To create my own classes, methods, and attributes that encapsulate the functionality of various algorithms, promoting better software design practices.
